Dear sir/madam,

I hope this email finds you in good health and spirits. I am writing to request your assistance in releasing a financial hold that has been placed on my student account. I have already made the payment for my tuition installment fees for this month and I am eager to register for the upcoming class.

I understand the importance of ensuring that all financial obligations are met, and I have taken the necessary steps to clear my account. Enclosed, you will find a copy of my receipt as proof of payment.

I would be most grateful if you could take the necessary steps to release the financial hold on my account as soon as possible, so that I may complete the registration process for my classes.

Thank you for your time and consideration in this matter. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely, 
Prashant Rana
